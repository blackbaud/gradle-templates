# Blackbaud Project Templates

This project is used to bootstrap new projects as well as adding to existing projects.  

There are times during development where the easiest way forward is to copy a set of classes and then proceed 
renaming/deleting/etc.  This project exists b/c that process is error prone and just generally sucks.


## Initialization

This project requires a primary workspace directory to be configred - a default root directory for all subsequent operations.

The default workspace is `..`, the directory where you checked out the gradle-templates project.  This value is stored
in `gradle/custom.gradle` which is initialized when the plugin is first applied.  Edit this file if you want to change 
the workspace directory.


## Usage

Run the `./gradlew tasks` command and look at the group `Template tasks` to see a list of the available tasks.

#### createRestProject

Creates a skeleton SpringBoot REST project (includes build.gradle, application class, and supporting classes)

#### createRestResource
